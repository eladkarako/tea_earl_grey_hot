Spamhaus Don't Route Or Peer List (DROP)
The DROP list will not include any IP address space under the control of any legitimate network - even if being used by "the spammers from hell". DROP will only include netblocks allocated directly by an established Regional Internet Registry (RIR) or National Internet Registry (NIR) such as ARIN, RIPE, AFRINIC, APNIC, LACNIC or KRNIC or direct RIR allocations.

Spamhaus Extended DROP List (EDROP)
EDROP is an extension of the DROP list that includes suballocated netblocks controlled by spammers or cyber criminals. EDROP is meant to be used in addition to the direct allocations on the DROP list.

Spamhaus IPv6 DROP List (DROPv6)
The DROPv6 list includes IPv6 ranges allocated to spammers or cyber criminals.

Spamhaus ASN DROP List (ASN-DROP)
ASN-DROP contains a list of Autonomous System Numbers controlled by spammers or cyber criminals, as well as "hijacked" ASNs. ASN-DROP can be used to filter BGP routes which are being used for malicious purposes. Due to operational constraints, this list will be suspended from service during the week commencing Monday 18th October.
